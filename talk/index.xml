Hyperproperties for Robotics: Planning via HyperLTL
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;:
There is a growing interest on formal methods based robotic planning for temporal logic objectives. In this work, we extend the scope of existing synthesis methods to hyper-temporal logics. We are motivated by the fact that important planning objectives, such as optimality, robustness, and privacy,(maybe implicitly) involve the interrelation between multiple paths. Such objectives are thus hyperproperties, and cannot be expressed with usual temporal logics like the linear temporal logic (LTL). We show that such hyperproperties can be expressed by HyperLTL, an extension of LTL to multiple paths. To handle the complexity of planning with HyperLTL specifications, we introduce a symbolic approach for synthesizing planning strategies on discrete transition systems. Our planning method is evaluated on several case studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;

Statistical Verification of Hyperproperties
for Cyber-Physical Systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;:
Many important properties of cyber-physical systems (CPS) are defined upon the relationship between multiple executions simultaneously in continuous time. Examples include probabilistic fairness and sensitivity to modeling errors (i.e., parameters changes) for real-valued signals. These requirements can only be specified by hyperproperties. In this talk, I will first introduce new hyper probabilistic temporal logics that formally capture these hyperproperties. Then, I will introduce new statistical model checking (SMC) techniques for verifying hyper logic formulas. Finally, I will demonstrate the efficiency of the SMC algorithms on CPS benchmarks with varying levels of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Talk Title&lt;/b&gt;:
Statistical Verification of Hyperproperties
for Cyber-Physical Systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;:
Many important properties of cyber-physical systems (CPS) are defined upon the relationship between multiple executions simultaneously in continuous time. Examples include probabilistic fairness and sensitivity to modeling errors (i.e., parameters changes) for real-valued signals. These requirements can only be specified by hyperproperties. In this work, we focus on verifying probabilistic hyperproperties for CPS. To cover a wide range of modeling formalisms, we first propose a general model of probabilistic uncertain systems (PUSs) that unify commonly studied CPS models such as continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) and probabilistically parametrized Hybrid I/O Automata. To formally specify hyperproperties, we propose a new temporal logic, hyper probabilistic signal temporal logic (HyperPSTL) that serves as a hyper and probabilistic version of the conventional signal temporal logic (STL). Considering complexity of real-world systems that can be captured as PUSs, we adopt a statistical model checking (SMC) approach for their verification. We develop a new SMC technique based on the direct computation of the significance levels of statistical assertions for HyperPSTL specifications, which requires no a priori knowledge on the indifference margin. Then, we introduce SMC algorithms for HyperPSTL specifications on the joint probabilistic distribution of multiple paths, as well as specifications with nested probabilistic operators quantifying different paths, which cannot be handled by existing SMC algorithms. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our SMC algorithms on CPS benchmarks with varying levels of complexity, including the Toyota Powertrain Control System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;

Statistical Verification of Learning-Based Cyber-Physical Systems
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;:
The use of Neural Network (NN)-based controllers has attracted significant attention in recent years. However, due to the complexity and non-linearity of such NN-based cyber-physical systems (CPS), existing verification techniques that employ exhaustive state-space search, face significant scalability challenges; this effectively limits their use for analyzes of real-world CPS. 
Consequently, in this work, we focus on the use of Statistical Model Checking (SMC) for verifying complex NN-controlled CPS. Using an SMC approach based on Clopper-Pearson confidence levels, we verify from samples specifications that are captured by Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas. Specifically, we consider three CPS benchmarks with varying levels of plant and controller complexity, as well as the type of considered STL properties -- reachability property for a mountain car, safety property for a bipedal robot, and control performance of the closed-loop magnet levitation system.
On these benchmarks, we show that SMC methods can be successfully used to provide high-assurance for learning-based CPS. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Title&lt;/b&gt;:
Verifying the Security of Cyber-Physical Systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;:
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) operate in a wide range of applications, where their security is a major concern. Verifying security properties, commonly specified by temporal logics, can be difficult, due to either the lack of accurate models or the models’ complexity. In this talk, several recent efforts on addressing this problem will be presented. First, I will present a new model reduction method for building approximate bisimulations between complex CPS and finite state Markov chains. Then, I will present a few new statistical model checking techniques using anti-correlated samples and reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
