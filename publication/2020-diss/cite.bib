 abstract = {Sensors and actuators are key control components of Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs). UAVs use them in a feedback-based control loop with the software components to accomplish goals. Today, we know that UAVs are susceptible to multiple forms of sensor spoofing attacks such as false data injection via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks and counterfeit signal generation. In this paper we pose two questions (a) ``Can a group of networked, distributed, UAVs (i.e., swarm) provide protection against sensor spoofing attacks?'' and (b) ``can modeling swarms using data-driven techniques provide defense against sensor data injection attacks?''. Using Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulations, we analyze the feasibility of learning the behavior of a UAV using a deep learning model. We use robustness testing and feasibility of data augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for this purpose.},
