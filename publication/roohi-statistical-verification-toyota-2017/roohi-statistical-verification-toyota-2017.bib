 abstract = {The Toyota Powertrain Control Verification Benchmark has been recently proposed as challenge problems that capture features of realistic automotive designs. In this paper we statistically verify the most complicated of the powertrain control models proposed, that includes features like delayed differential and difference equations, look-up tables, and highly non-linear dynamics, by simulating the C++ code generated from the SimulinkTM model of the design. Our results show that for at least 98% of the possible initial operating conditions the desired properties hold. These are the first verification results for this model, statistical or otherwise.},
