abstract: "In this paper, we introduce a logic-based discrete path planning technique for multi-agent robotic systems. % in the presence of adversaries. The novelty of our approach stems from the theory of hyperproperties. A hyperproperty is a set of sets of execution traces, expressing the property of a set of executions, rather then traditional trace-based languages that describe properties of individual executions. The inherent multi-trace nature of hyperproperties makes them a highly desirable framework to specify objectives and intended behaviors of controllable robots and uncontrollable adversaries in multi-agent systems. We specify several path planning problems in the temporal logic HyperLTL --- a generalization of the Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that allows for simultaneous and explicit quantification over execution traces. We show that HyperLTL can capture many important path planning requirements such as optimization, privacy, priority, and adversarial control policies. We reduce the path planning problem to the HyperLTL verification problem for bounded executions and utilize a solution based on solving the satisfiability problem for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Our experiments show %very encouraging results the applicability of our method in terms of generality and the diversity of path planning problems as well as efficiency and effectiveness of our approach."
