abstract: "In this work, we study the problem of statistically verifying Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) formulas on discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs) with stratified and antithetic samples. We show that by properly choosing the representation of the DTMCs, semantically negatively correlated samples can be generated for a fraction of PCTL formulas via the stratified or antithetic sampling techniques. Using stratified or antithetic samples, we propose statistical verification algorithms with asymptotic correctness guarantees based on sequential probability ratio tests, and show that these algorithms are more sample-efficient than the algorithms using independent Monte Carlo sampling. Finally, the efficiency of the statistical verification algorithm with stratified and antithetic samples is demonstrated by numerical experiments on several benchmarks."
