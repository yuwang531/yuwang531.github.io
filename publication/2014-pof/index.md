abstract: "We study the dynamic wetting of shear-thickening power-law fluids in a liquid-solid-gas contact system. In the previous model based on hydrodynamic analysis, microscopic effects near the contact line are neglected. In this work, we adopt two different physical models, slip boundary model and molecular force model, to incorporate microscopic effects and relieve the stress singularity at the moving contact line in hydrodynamics analysis. The two models, which are mathematically equivalent for Newtonian fluids, lead to different results on the dependence of the liquid's dynamic contact angle on its moving speed in both complete wetting and partial wetting cases. By comparing with experiments, we find that the slip boundary model matches the experiments better than the previous model and the molecular force model."
