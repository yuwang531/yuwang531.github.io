 abstract = {STMC is a statistical model checker that uses 
antithetic and stratified sampling techniques 
to reduce the number of samples and, hence, 
the amount of time required before making a decision. 
The tool is capable of statistically verifying any  
black-box probabilistic system that PRISM can simulate, 
against probabilistic bounds on any property that PRISM 
can evaluate over individual executions of the system. 
We have evaluated our tool on many examples and compared 
it with both symbolic and statistical algorithms. 
Our experimental results show that our techniques 
are indeed able to reduce the number of samples significantly. 
When the number of strata is large, our algorithms 
reduced the number of samples 336% on average.
Furthermore, being a statistical model checker makes STMC 
able to verify models that are well beyond the reach of current 
symbolic model checkers. 
On large systems (up to 10e14 states) 
STMC was able to check 100% of benchmark systems, 
compared to existing methods which only succeeded on 14% of systems.
The tool, installation instructions, benchmarks, and
scripts for running the benchmarks are all available online
as open source.},
