abstract: "In this work, we discuss the stability of a discrete-time linear autonomous system under regular switching sequences, whose switching sequences are generated by a Muller automaton. The asymptotic stability of this system, referred to as regular asymptotic stability, generalizes two well-known definitions of stability of autonomous discrete-time linear switched systems, namely absolute asymptotic stability (AAS) and shuffle asymptotic stability (SAS). We also extend these stability definitions to robust versions. We prove that absolute asymptotic stability, robust absolute asymptotic stability and robust shuffle asymptotic stability are equivalent to exponential stability. In addition, by using the Kronecker product, we prove that a robust regular asymptotic stability problem is equivalent to the conjunction of several robust absolute asymptotic stability problems."
