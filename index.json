Consequently, in this work, we focus on the use of Statistical Model Checking (SMC) for verifying complex NN-controlled CPS. Using an SMC approach based on Clopper-Pearson confidence levels, we verify from samples specifications defined by Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas. Specifically, we consider three CPS benchmarks with varying levels of plant and controller complexity, as well as the type of considered STL properties -- reachability property for a mountain car, safety property for a bipedal robot, and control performance of the closed-loop magnet levitation system.

However, since the environmental state depends on the behavior of the agents, sharing it directly among these agents jeopardizes the privacy of the agents' profiles, defined as the combination of the agents' initial states and the sequence of local control inputs over time. A commonly used solution is to randomize the environmental state before sharing - this leads to a natural trade-off between the privacy of the agents' profiles and the variance of estimating the environmental state. By treating the multi-agent system as a probabilistic model of the environmental state parametrized by the agents' profiles, we show that when the agents' profiles is e-differentially private, there is a lower bound on the l1 induced norm of the covariance matrix of the minimum-variance unbiased estimator of the environmental state.

In this paper, we formulate and study a natural tradeoff arising in these problems between the privacy of the agent's data and the performance of the control system. We formalize privacy in terms of differential privacy of agents' preference vectors. The overall control system consists of N agents with linear discrete-time coupled dynamics, each controlled to track its preference vector. Performance of the system is measured by the mean squared tracking error. We present a mechanism that achieves differential privacy by adding Laplace noise to the shared information in a way that depends on the sensitivity of the control system to the private data. We show that for stable systems the performance cost of using this type of privacy preserving mechanism grows as O(T3/N$ε$2), where T is the time horizon and $ε$ is the privacy parameter. For unstable systems, the cost grows exponentially with time. From an estimation point of view, we establish a lower-bound for the entropy of any unbiased estimator of the private data from any noise-adding mechanism that gives $ε$-differential privacy.

The algorithm relies on a result from linear control theory that enables us to decompose and compute the reachable states of the system in terms of a symbolic simulation of the adversary-free dynamics and the total uncertainty induced by the adversary. With this decomposition, the synthesis problem eliminates the universal quantifier on the adversary's choices and the symbolic controller actions can be effectively solved using an SMT solver. The constraints induced by the adversary are computed by solving second-order cone programmings.

In this problem, the difficulty is twofold: the objective functions are used repeatedly in every iteration, and the influence of perturbing them extends to other agents and lasts over time. To solve the problem, we analyze the propagation of perturbations on objective functions over time, and derive an upper bound on them.

To statistically verify iLTL formulas on the systems, we first reformulate discrete-time nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems into Markov processes on their continuous state spaces and then reduce them to discrete-time Markov chains (DTMC) using set-oriented methods. Furthermore, a statistical verification algorithm is proposed to verify iLTL formulas on the reduced systems. The correctness of this statistical verification algorithm is checked both by theoretical analysis and the simulation of a fluid problem.
