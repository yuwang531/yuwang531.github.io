Examples include probabilistic fairness and sensitivity to modeling errors (i.e., parameters changes) for real-valued signals. These requirements can only be specified by hyperproperties. In this work, we focus on verifying probabilistic hyperproperties for CPS. To cover a wide range of modeling formalisms, we first propose a general model of probabilistic uncertain systems (PUSs) that unify commonly studied CPS models such as continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) and probabilistically parametrized Hybrid I/O Automata. To formally specify hyperproperties, we propose a new temporal logic, hyper probabilistic signal temporal logic (HyperPSTL) that serves as a hyper and probabilistic version of the conventional signal temporal logic (STL). Considering complexity of real-world systems that can be captured as PUSs, we adopt a statistical model checking (SMC) approach for their verification. We develop a new SMC technique based on the direct computation of the significance levels of statistical assertions for HyperPSTL specifications, which requires no a priori knowledge on the indifference margin. Then, we introduce SMC algorithms for HyperPSTL specifications on the joint probabilistic distribution of multiple paths, as well as specifications with nested probabilistic operators quantifying different paths, which cannot be handled by existing SMC algorithms. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our SMC algorithms on CPS benchmarks with varying levels of complexity, including the Toyota Powertrain Control System.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical Verification of Hyperproperties for Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Wang","Nima Roohi","Matthew West","Mahesh Viswanathan","Geir E.

Using stratified or antithetic samples, we propose statistical verification algorithms with asymptotic correctness guarantees based on sequential probability ratio tests, and show that these algorithms are more sample-efficient than the algorithms using independent Monte Carlo sampling. Finally, the efficiency of the statistical verification algorithm with stratified and antithetic samples is demonstrated by numerical experiments on several benchmarks.","tags":null,"title":"Verifying Stochastic Hybrid Systems with Temporal Logic Specifications via Mori-Zwanzig Model Reduction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"fca79cf2fc432756a7c550b8cf461a34","permalink":"https://yuwang531.github.io/publication/wang-statistical-verification-differential-2018/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T23:57:56.361966Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-statistical-verification-differential-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"This thesis studies the statistical verification and differential privacy in Cyber-Physical Systems. The first part focuses on the statistical verification of stochastic hybrid system, a class of formal models for Cyber-Physical Systems. Model reduction techniques are performed on both Discrete-Time and Continuous-Time Stochastic Hybrid Systems to reduce them to Discrete-Time Markov Chains and Continuous-Time Markov Chains, respectively; and statistical verification algorithms are proposed to verify Linear Inequality LTL and Metric Interval Temporal Logic on these discrete probabilistic models. In addition, the advantage of stratified sampling in verifying Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic on Labeled Discrete-Time Markov Chains is studied; this method can potentially be extended to other statistical verification algorithms to reduce computational costs. The second part focuses on the Differential Privacy in multi-agent systems that involve share information sharing to achieve overall control goals. A general formulation of the systems and a notion of Differential Privacy are proposed, and a trade-off between the Differential Privacy and the tracking performance of the systems is demonstrated. In addition, it is proved that there is a trade-off between Differential Privacy and the entropy of the unbiased estimator of the private data, and an optimal algorithm to achieve the best trade-off is given.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical Verification and Differential Privacy in Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Wang","Nima Roohi","Matthew West","Mahesh Viswanathan","Geir E.

However, since the environmental state depends on the behavior of the agents, sharing it directly among these agents jeopardizes the privacy of the agents' profiles, defined as the combination of the agents' initial states and the sequence of local control inputs over time. A commonly used solution is to randomize the environmental state before sharing - this leads to a natural trade-off between the privacy of the agents' profiles and the variance of estimating the environmental state. By treating the multi-agent system as a probabilistic model of the environmental state parametrized by the agents' profiles, we show that when the agents' profiles is e-differentially private, there is a lower bound on the l1 induced norm of the covariance matrix of the minimum-variance unbiased estimator of the environmental state. This lower bound is achieved by a randomized mechanism that uses Laplace noise.","tags":null,"title":"Differential Privacy and Minimum-Variance Unbiased Estimation in Multi-Agent Control Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Wang","Zhenqi Huang","Sayan Mitra","Geir E.

In this paper, we formulate and study a natural tradeoff arising in these problems between the privacy of the agent's data and the performance of the control system. We formalize privacy in terms of differential privacy of agents' preference vectors. The overall control system consists of N agents with linear discrete-time coupled dynamics, each controlled to track its preference vector. Performance of the system is measured by the mean squared tracking error. We present a mechanism that achieves differential privacy by adding Laplace noise to the shared information in a way that depends on the sensitivity of the control system to the private data. We show that for stable systems the performance cost of using this type of privacy preserving mechanism grows as O(T3/N$ε$2), where T is the time horizon and $ε$ is the privacy parameter. For unstable systems, the cost grows exponentially with time. From an estimation point of view, we establish a lower-bound for the entropy of any unbiased estimator of the private data from any noise-adding mechanism that gives $ε$-differential privacy. We show that the mechanism achieving this lower-bound is a randomized mechanism that also uses Laplace noise.","tags":null,"title":"Differential Privacy in Linear Distributed Control Systems: Entropy Minimizing Mechanisms and Performance Tradeoffs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Wang","Nima Roohi","Geir E.

After formulating the problem in a general setting, we present a sound and complete algorithm for the case with linear dynamics and an adversary with a budget on the total L2-norm of its actions. The algorithm relies on a result from linear control theory that enables us to decompose and compute the reachable states of the system in terms of a symbolic simulation of the adversary-free dynamics and the total uncertainty induced by the adversary. With this decomposition, the synthesis problem eliminates the universal quantifier on the adversary's choices and the symbolic controller actions can be effectively solved using an SMT solver. The constraints induced by the adversary are computed by solving second-order cone programmings. The algorithm is later extended to synthesize state-dependent controller and to generate attacks for the adversary.

In this problem, the difficulty is twofold: the objective functions are used repeatedly in every iteration, and the influence of perturbing them extends to other agents and lasts over time. To solve the problem, we analyze the propagation of perturbations on objective functions over time, and derive an upper bound on them. With the upper bound, we design a noise-adding mechanism that randomizes the cloud-based distributed optimization algorithm to keep the individual objective functions $ε$-differentially private.

To statistically verify iLTL formulas on the systems, we first reformulate discrete-time nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems into Markov processes on their continuous state spaces and then reduce them to discrete-time Markov chains (DTMC) using set-oriented methods. Furthermore, a statistical verification algorithm is proposed to verify iLTL formulas on the reduced systems. The correctness of this statistical verification algorithm is checked both by theoretical analysis and the simulation of a fluid problem.
